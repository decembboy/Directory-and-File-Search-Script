# Directory-and-File-Search-Script

Directory and File Search Script
This repository contains a Python script designed to traverse directories and files, and perform simple checks based on user-defined conditions.


Overview


The script performs the following functions:
1.	Walks through directories and subdirectories starting from a specified path.
2.	Collects the names of all directories and files.
3.	Checks if a specified string (enter) is present in any of the filenames
4.	And opens the file in the local machine 

Note:  I wanted to let you know that I wrote the entire code myself for the project However, I am currently facing a challenge with a specific part of the code. I need to write a function that will open a file on any local machine if a certain flag is set to 1. Could you please provide some guidance
